\section{Conclusion}
\label{conclusion}
In this paper, to predict the execution time of Apache Spark jobs interfered with other jobs, we develop an interference model. This model combines the execution information and resource consumption profile for each stage of Apache Spark jobs to calculate the slowdown ratio resulting from the interference, and then predicts the execution time when interfered with other jobs. Furthermore, an interference aware job scheduling algorithm leveraging the analytical framework is designed for Apache Spark platform. The developed models and the algorithm are evaluated using four real-life applications (e.g., Page rank , K-means, Logistic regression, Word count) on a 6 node cluster while running up to four jobs concurrently. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework can achieve high prediction accuracy and reduces average execution time for individual jobs significantly, thereby improving the system utilization.
