%\boldmath
Apache Spark is an open source distributed data processing platform that uses distributed memory abstraction to process large volume of data efficiently. However, performance of a particular job on Apache Spark platform can vary significantly depending on the input data type and size, design and implementation of the algorithm, and computing capability, making it extremely difficult to predict the performance metric of a job such as execution time, memory footprint, and I/O cost. To address this challenge, in this paper, we present a simulation driven prediction model that can predict job performance with high accuracy for Apache Spark platform. Specifically, as Apache spark jobs are often consist of multiple sequential stages, the presented prediction model simulates the execution of the actual job by using only a fraction of the input data, and collect execution traces (e.g., I/O overhead, memory consumption, execution time) to predict job performance for each execution stage individually. We evaluated our prediction framework using four real-life applications on a 13 node cluster, and experimental results show that the model can achieve high prediction accuracy.
