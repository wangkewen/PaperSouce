\noindent
This paper presents a performance prediction framework for jobs running on Apache Spark platform. We establish models for predicting job performance by simulating the execution of actual job in a limited scale on real cluster. The prediction accuracy is evaluated for iterative and non-iterative algorithms. While the prediction accuracy is found to be high for execution time and memory, the I/O cost prediction varied for different applications. We strongly believe that our proposed approach can be used to predict job execution time with high-accuracy in real-life and will lead towards better resource allocation framework.
