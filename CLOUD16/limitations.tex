While our model can predict performance degradation due to interference among multiple Apache Spark jobs with high accuracy, we do acknowledge several limitations of our current work as follows. First, our model assumes that the stages within a job are executed sequentially and does not consider the possibility of parallel execution, which will require extending our models. Second, the model was evaluated on 6 node cluster with 4 concurrent jobs, which is smaller compared to real-life clusters. Furthermore, the value $\beta_{n}$ depends on the number of concurrent jobs and needs to be calculated (once) as the number of concurrent jobs grows in a system. However, we strongly believe that our modeling framework will work well once the parameters are estimated for different cluster size and number of concurrent jobs in a system, which we plan to investigate in our future work.
